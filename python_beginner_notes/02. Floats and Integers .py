# Python has 2 types of number values:
    1. int()
        # Integers are whole numbers
            eg. 1, 97, 420
    
    2. float()
        # Floats are number values with decimals 
            eg. 1.5, 23.83, 25.0

TIP:
# they can both be converted from one to another, for example:
    # Rounded to the nearest whole number with no decimals
        print(int(25.6)) 
            output: 26
    
    # floats and integers can also be converted into strings:
        print(str(25.6))
            output: 25.6
