# Python uses the standard math ORDER OF OPERATIONS 
    B.I.M.D.A.S.
        Brackets            ()
        Indeces             **
        Multiplication      *
        Division            /
        Addition            +
        Subtraction         -
        
    Extra:
        Remainder           %

TIPS:
# The multiplcaion(*) operator is the only operator that can be used on a string value
    eg. print('hello' * 3)
        output: hellohellohello

# the division(/) operator's output will be converted into a float, even if its a whole number
    eg. print(15 / 5)
        output: 3.0

USES:
# you can build a simple calculator using these operators
